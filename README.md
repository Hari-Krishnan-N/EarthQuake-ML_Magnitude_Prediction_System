# üåç Earthquake Magnitude Prediction

## üìä Project Overview

This project implements machine learning techniques to predict earthquake magnitudes using historical seismic data. By leveraging advanced regression algorithms, we aim to develop accurate predictive models that could potentially contribute to early warning systems and risk assessment strategies.

### Key Features

- **Multiple ML Models**: Implementation and comparison of Linear Regression (LR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forest Regression (RFR).
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Detailed evaluation of model performance with visualizations.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Robust handling of missing values and feature engineering.
- **Easy Reproducibility**: Well-documented code with clear instructions.

## üîç Motivation

Earthquakes are natural disasters that can cause significant damage and loss of life. Accurate prediction of earthquake magnitudes is crucial for:

- Developing effective early warning systems
- Improving disaster planning and response
- Enhancing risk assessment for vulnerable areas
- Advancing scientific understanding of seismic activity

## üìã Dataset

The analysis is performed on the `Earthquake Data.csv` dataset which includes historical earthquake records with features such as:

- Geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude)
- Depth of the earthquake
- Time and date of occurrence
- Various seismic measurements
- Other relevant attributes

## üìà Model Performance

After rigorous testing and evaluation, our comparative analysis revealed:

![Model Comparison](results/Results.png)

| Model              | MSE       | RMSE     | R¬≤ Score |
|--------------------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Linear Regression  | 0.177406  | 0.421196 | 0.078254 |
| SVM                | 0.181780  | 0.426357 | 0.055528 |
| Random Forest      | 0.137559  | 0.370890 | 0.285286 |


Among the three models evaluated‚ÄîLinear Regression, SVM, and Random Forest‚Äîthe Random Forest model performs the best.

**Key findings:**
- **Random Forest Regression (RFR)** demonstrated superior performance with the highest R¬≤ score and lowest error metrics
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** showed moderate predictive capability
- **Linear Regression (LR)** provided a useful baseline but was less effective for capturing the complex, non-linear relationships in seismic data
